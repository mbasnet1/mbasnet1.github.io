#### `$whoami`

I am Uddhav P. Gautam. I am currently working as a researcher in the Linux Kernel and eBPF space at Virginia Tech, where my focus is on
exploring and improving various kernel components. My work includes developing eBPF-based tracing and profiling use
cases, and instrumenting the kernel for both micro and macro benchmarking. I’ve also published a paper on eliminating
eBPF tracing overhead on untraced processes. In addition, I’ve developed kernel modules for various use cases, such as propagating user-space code into kernel-space
and triggering kernel functions. As part of my research, I added a custom Kfunc to enhance eBPF, enabling it to
serialize and deserialize Protocol Buffers (protobuf). I also created an in-kernel firewall using protobuf data and
integrated user-space tools like pbtool for processing protocol buffers in the kernel.

Additionally, I use tracing tools such as BPFTrace, Strace, and Ftrace for debugging and performance testing to drive
further optimizations in the Linux Kernel and its networking stack. I am also working on porting my research findings to
the Android Kernel to extend the impact of my work and improve performance across both platforms.

I am currently working towards my PhD in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia
Tech</a>, under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/people/faculty/dan-williams.html" target="_blank">
Dan Williams</a>. Previously, I was a Mobile Solutions Technical Lead & Architect
at <a href="https://www.perficient.com/" target="_blank">Perficient Inc </a> contracting for TD Ameritrade -- now owned
